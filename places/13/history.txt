The history of the temple goes back to the late 1800s, when Shri Dagdusheth Halwai, a famous sweet maker and trader in Pune, and his wife Lakshmibai lost their only son to a plague epidemic. They were grief-stricken and sought solace in their guru, who advised them to build a temple devoted to Lord Ganesha. They followed his advice and installed a beautiful idol of Ganesha made of gold and precious stones in their shop. They also started celebrating the Ganesh festival with great devotion and enthusiasm, inviting their neighbours and friends to join them. Soon, the temple became a public place of worship and a symbol of pride and honor for Pune.The temple is managed by Shreemant Dagdusheth Halwai Sarvajanik Ganpati Trust, which is also involved in various social welfare and cultural activities. The temple has a simple but elegant structure, with a large window that allows the devotees to see the idol from outside. The idol is adorned with gold ornaments and flowers, and has an expressive face that radiates peace and joy. The temple also has two marble statues of Jay and Vijay, the gatekeepers of Lord Vishnu's abode, at the entrance. The temple also has a shrine dedicated to Goddess Ekveera, who is worshipped by the Koli fishermen community.
