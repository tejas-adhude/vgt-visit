Winter, from November to February, is the best time to explore the fort. It’s in winter when the weather is the most comfortable for exploring every nook and corner of the fort.If you can, visit Shivneri Fort in monsoon season (July-September). The conditions aren’t the most ideal, though, and the trail is slippery. But you can get a good view of the surrounding greenery while enjoying your trek with the cool breeze.
