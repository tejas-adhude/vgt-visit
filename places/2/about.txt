If you have an hour or two to spare and want to go for a short drive, then a visit to Ramdara temple would fit perfectly. We were at the newly opened Kumar Pacific mall and finished at around 4.30 pm. I had been mentioning about Ramdara for quite some time and since we had a few hrs in the day left, we decided to go. We were back in Pune by around 6.30 pm. A short and sweet drive!
