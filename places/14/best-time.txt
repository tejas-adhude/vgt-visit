November to February are the best months to visit Bhimashankar. Though the temple can be visited anytime of the year, trekkers can visit during winters if they are first time climbers as the climb can be tough during the monsoons because of the slopes being slippery. However, experienced trekkers will find trekking in monsoon quite pleasing because of its challenging nature and the chill weather.
