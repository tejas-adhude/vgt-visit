The Bhima River (also known as Chandrabhaga River) is a major river in Western India and South India. It flows southeast for 861 kilometres (535 mi) through Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Telangana states, before entering the Krishna River. After the first sixty-five kilometers in a narrow valley through rugged terrain,[1] the banks open up and form a fertile agricultural area which is densely populated.
